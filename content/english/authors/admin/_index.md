In 2019, I graduated with a combined BSc/MSc in Mechanical Engineering from Arts et Métiers ParisTech. I then pursued my studies in project management in a work-study program at IAE Paris and Natixis. Through these experiences, I worked on the management of artificial intelligence projects and wrote a master's thesis on the challenge of banks to evolve towards a data-driven strategy. 

My will to specialise in data science led me to move to Canada where I graduated a master's degree at Polytechnique Montreal. Back in France, I decided to work on a meaningful project. That's why I'm currently working at Sibius, a company created following the work of the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) on the early detection of cognitive disorders.

You'll find on this site a summary of my various IT projects.
